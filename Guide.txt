- The folder contains all data and code used for the master thesis
- Input data are monthly and daily return data from the Kenneth French Data Library and recession indicators from FRED
- The code is split into two files: the first contains the main code, the second the code for the analysis
of flexible rebalancing periods (seperated due to self-contained nature and extensiveness of calculations)
- When first used, the command "font_import()" has to be run to install additional font types
- Particularly the second code needs, depending on computing power, some time (~20 minutes)
